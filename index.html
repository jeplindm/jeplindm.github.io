        <h2>What Do You Know About Whisky?</h2>

        <p id = "first">Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.</p>

        <!--History-->
        <div id="History">

        <h2>History of Whisky</h2>

        <p>....By the 1880s, the French brandy industry was devastated by the phylloxera pest that ruined much of the grape crop; as a result, whisky became the primary liquor in many markets. <br><br>
        During the Prohibition era in the United States lasting from 1920 to 1933, all alcohol sales were banned in the country. The federal government made an exemption for whisky prescribed by a doctor and sold through licensed pharmacies. During this time, the Walgreens pharmacy chain grew from 20 retail stores to almost 400. </p>

        <h2>Production</h2>

        <ul>

        <li><h4 class= "process">Distillation</h4></li>
        <p>A still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). <br><br>
        The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol. </p>

        <li><h4 class= "process">Aging</h4></li>
        <p>Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the "age" of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. <br><br>
        Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are not "older" and not necessarily "better" than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky.</p>

        <li><h4 class= "process">Packaging</h4></li>
        <p>
        Most whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% abv, which is the statutory minimum in some countries – although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage. 
        </p>

        <li><h4 class= "process">Exports</h4></li>
        <p>
        Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products. Exports have increased by 87% in the decade to 2012 and it contributes over £4.25 billion to the UK economy, making up a quarter of all its food and drink revenues. <br><br>
        In 2012, the US was the largest market for Scotch whisky (£655 million), followed by France (£535 million). It is also one of the UK's overall top five manufacturing export earners and it supports around 35,000 jobs.Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay, where there are nine distilleries providing a major source of employment. <br><br>
        In many places, the industry is closely linked to tourism, with many distilleries also functioning as attractions worth £30 million GVA each year.
